# TfTracker

A simple tool to help Teamfight Tactics (TFT) players. TFT is developed by Riot Games where players build a team and compete against 7 other players to be the last one alive. This tool is designed to track which opponents the user has faced to derive a smaller pool of possible opponents the user will face in the next rounds. Then players will be able to scout these opponents in-game and analyze their weaknesses. This can be viewed here https://tft-scouter.herokuapp.com
